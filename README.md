# TODO
* Make a list and preview layout, for the Projects and Experiences tabs
* Add interactive demos/webtoys for certain javascript projects
* tweak the grid and vingette overlay some more, maybe add more post processing effects for even less visual clarity.
* improve svg divs to have a boolean to render inverted colors : filled instead of transparent background to ensure the icon is overall sqaure.
  - should debug why foreground and background colors are not transitioning for these divs.
